# Apriori

The implementation of the apriori algorithm for persian text file.
+ First: uploads the text files
+ Second: removes the stopwords (most commenly used words of a specific language)
+ Third: performs the algorithm and returns a dataframe of most frequent patterns

I've uploaded the stopword file, for those who might not find it.
